		<h2>Primrose Center, Inc.’s Website Re-design</h2>
		<p class="name">by Luis F. Calderon</p>
		
		<p>The website redesign objective of Primrose Center is to re-organize, 
		and create more interactive content, but most importantly is to create a 
		long lasting relationship with visitors.</p>
		<div class="horizontalLine"></div>
		<h3 class="gradient">Site Intent</h3>
		
		<p>The intent for this project is to redesign Primrose Center Inc.’s website. 
		I want to give the site a different feel to it by redesigning layout and 
		structure of the site. Presently, the website is outdated and at first glance is 
		difficult to determine what you can do because of the excess links and large 
		sections. The website currently has 8 web pages. I plan to consolidate certain 
		information to be able not only to shrink the website to 6 pages, but also make 
		room for new material. Currently, Primrose Center’s website has the content 
		distributed in the following pages: home, services, about us, affiliates, history,
	    partners in giving, business partnerships and board of directors. My goal is to 
	    consolidate the following pages: affiliates,history, business partnerships and 
	    board of directors into the about us section. I feel all the content found in 
	    those pages all fall under the same category.</p>
	    
	    <p>By consolidating these pages I will be able to make room for new content 
	    and keep the website at 6 webpages. The re-design of the site will keep the 
	    following pages: home, about us, and services. And the three new pages are: 
	    apply now, volunteer and testimonial. The purpose of creating these new pages 
	    is to increase website traffic, and engage visitors, so they want to become a 
	    member whether you want to apply for counseling or become a volunteer. Primrose 
	    Center is a non-profit organization so they need all the help they can get, 
	    and involving the community is key to success for organizations like Primrose 
	    Center. The other new page is testimonial, it actually will be the partners
	    in giving page the website currently has, but with a different name.</p>
	    
	    <p>By creating a user-friendly interface we can deliver a better experience 
	    to the visitors. Is important to keep a consistent pattern throughout the 
	    layout and organize content to direct potential members to the main 
	    call to action.</p>
	    
	    <h3 class="gradient">Competitive Analysis</h3> 
	    
	    <p>After researching in Alexa.com, I found no data regarding Primrose Center’s
	     website. Currently, this website has 0 traffic rank. When exploring the 
	     Primrose Center’s website, I feel the site needs more keywords to attract 
	     the visitors attention. This will definitely generate more traffic for the
	     website by giving people a reason to stay on the site. Also, there are many 
	     non-profit organizations that thrive on community support. Primrose has a 
	     great opportunity in that area and it is to grab the attention of their 
	     community and close neighbors. </p>
	     
	     <p>If Primrose Center wants to gain market share, they need to tap into their
	     close by demographics. But, most important, the websites needs to have keywords
	     that other competitors are using. Also, Primrose should practice on updating 
	     or creating new content for their users, that way the users don’t feel that
	     they are in an obsolete site that has no type of new activity.</p>

		 <p>A competitor that I found in the Orlando area is Rockorlando.org. 
		 This organization is dedicated to transforming the lives of members of 
		 our society. Rock Orlando uses a biblical approach to change the live of 
		 individuals. The Rock Orlando website barely has no statistics. The only 
		 statistic that I found is that it has a traffic rank of 11,509,880 
		 in global rank. The biggest strategy of the success of this website is the 
		 implementation of keywords and selection of images. Rockorlando.org has a 
		 great design, and can be an excellent reference when making design decisions 
		 for the re-design of Primrosecenter.org.</p>

		<h3 class="gradient">Targeted Audience</h3>
		
		<p>My goal is to target individual from 18-40 years old but open to all ages.
		 All person under the age of 18 must have permission from parent or guardian. 
		 After looking up Primrose Center on Alexa.com I found no data for this website.
		 Hopefully with the re-design of Primrose Center website we can attract the 
		 local demographic in the area of Orlando thus increasing the traffic rank
		 of this website and increasing the number of members in the Primrose Center 
		 Organization.</p>
