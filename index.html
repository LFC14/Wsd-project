					<p class="answer to why is a resume important?"> A resume is your
					 own personal document that outlines your past work experience, your
					 past education, your past achievements, as well as your current 
					 objectives.<em> Resumes tell an employer a great deal about you.</em> 
					 Where you have been, where you are and where you are headed. However,
				 	 the story must be told quickly and clearly. The purpose of the resume 
				 	 is to get the interview. After reading it, employers should want to 
				 	 get to know you better. <span> Your resume is your friend, if properly prepared.
