     	<h4>Sophia Loren is a world-renowned Italian actress<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Diplomata+SC' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'></h4>
	
		<P id="bio">Sophia Loren was born Sofia Scicolone in the charity ward of a Rome hospital
		 on Sept. 20, 1934. In 1949, Loren was runner-up in the Miss Italy contest and 
		 began to make small film appearances under the name Sofia Lazzaro. <strong>Italian
		 actress</strong> and bonafide screen goddess Sophia Loren made over 100 films in
		 her 50-year career, remaining one of the most beloved and recognizable figures
		 in the international film world. </p>
		 
		 <p>Much of her success could be found in the 
		 films of Italian director Vittorio De Sica, who called her "the essential 
		 Italian woman" and who captured her earthy, authentic sensibilities in
	     romantic comedies and gut-wrenching dramas alike.</p>
	      
        <P>Throughout her career, Loren worked with some of <span>film's</span> most renowned directors 
         and leading men, but the bulk of her artistic achievements remained in Italian
         cinema and opposite her frequent lead, Marcello Mastroianni.</P>
